gunncoll0001,kindred-butler.jpg,Kindred,"Dana’s torment begins when she suddenly vanishes on her 26th birthday from California, 1976, and is dragged through time to antebellum Maryland to rescue a boy named Rufus, heir to a slaveowner’s plantation. She soon realizes the purpose of her summons to the past: protect Rufus to ensure his assault of her Black ancestor so that she may one day be born. As she endures the traumas of slavery and the soul-crushing normalization of savagery, Dana fights to keep her autonomy and return to the present.","Butler, Octavia",1979,Southern California; Time travel; 1976; East Coast plantation; 19th Century; Racial Oppression; Slavery; Gender Oppression; African American Women's Experiences,image/jpeg,,,,,,Image;StillImage,eng,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
